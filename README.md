# PR-Clinic Introduction
PR Clinic in the context of github typically refers to an event or initiative focused on conducting code review clinics or sessions to help contributors improve their pull requests and enhance the quality of code submissions. This concept involves
their PRs' quality, adherence to best practices, and overall contribution to a project.

1. Define the objectives - Clarify the objectives of the PR clinic. Is it to enhance code quality, educate contributors, or increase the number of high-quality PRs ?

to better code quality.

3. Provide recognition and encouragement : recognize participants efforts and improvements made during the clinic. Encourage ongoing learning and improvement, and motivate participants to apply the feedback received to future contributions.

4. Collect feedback and evaluate : Encourage participants to provide feedback about their experiences during the clinic, including what worked well and areas for improvement.
